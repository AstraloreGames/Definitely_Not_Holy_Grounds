Bryan bets Satan that Felix will like butler cafe job better and Satan wuz liek ur on bro
Satan speaks liek this
Felix can make a choice to work at either cafe
Option 1: Refuses, stays at maid cafe
Satan burns down the butler cafe for teh lulz. If you laughed, and supported her arson problem, you get Satan. If you don’t, all butlers become trap maids (because you saved them from the fire)
Option 2: Agrees, tries out butler cafe
Satan accidentally burns down maid cafe – if you help her, then you can get the harem ending. If you don’t, everyone dies and you laugh from Bryan’s arms
Option 3: Quit your job
Walk the lonely plains of Purgatory forever :’C
