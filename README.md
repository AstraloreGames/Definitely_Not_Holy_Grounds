# Definitely_Not_Holy_Grounds
Created at the Instant Games panel at Flower City Comic Con 2017. Two rival cafes make a wager to win the loyalty of a star employee. All Hell breaks loose.

# What is this?
Definitely Not Holy Grounds is a visual novel created with audience participation at FCCC2017. Basically, the audience yells ideas at us and we write them down as fast as we can and throw together a VN with them. The game is incomplete due to time constraints, and the original notes are in `Notes.md`.

# How do I play this?
- Go to https://renpy.org/ and download Ren'py onto your computer. 
- Run it, and go to 'Preferences' (it's below 'Launch Project' in the lower right corner!). The Projects Directory will tell you where your Ren'Py Projects folder is saved, which is where you will need to save a copy of Definitely Not Holy Grounds to run it. 
- On the GitHub page for DNHG, click the green button that says 'Clone or Download' and select Download ZIP. 
- Open your ZIP and extract it to that Ren'Py Projects folder you found earlier.
- Launch project through Ren'py.

If you run into any trouble, let us know!

# How do I send back my changes?
GitHub is a site specifically for people to collaborate on projects using a version control system called Git. To try it out, you'll need to:
- Get a GitHub account.
- Install Git: https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git
- Then fork the repository, basically creating a copy of it for yourself. Instructions are here: https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/ 
- Once you've made the changes you'd like, you'll need to commit them (This is something you can find out how to do in a tutorial on using Git. On the command line, sections "Staging Files for Commit" and "Committing Changes" in this link cover how to do it: https://www.sitepoint.com/git-for-beginners/)
- Push your changes (`git push` on the command line) to send them to your fork.
- Send a pull request: https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/

We'll get to it as soon as we can!
