Please bear in mind that these notes were written quickly while being bombardarded with suggestions by an eager audience. They are rough, vague, and written in such a way as to entertain the viewers of the panel. Needless to say, they are not the most professional of notes.

They are divided into sections, which are Rough Concept, Characters, and Plotline. Rough Concept were the early ideas that were suggested for the overall game concept, and many of them were not used in the final plot. Characters and Plotline are self-explanatory.
